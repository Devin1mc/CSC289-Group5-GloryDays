# CSC289-Group5-GloryDays
This is for CSC289 group 5's capstone project which will be the Glory Days Management System

## Description
The Glory Days Management System is an inventory system made specifically for a small video game retail store called Glory Days. The system will allow store owners and employees keep track of their store's current inventory stock. Owners and managers will also be able to keep track of employees as well as monthly revenue through the use of their admin panel. Games can be stored based on their console type, condition, their packaging/case, and quantity in stock. When a sale is made, employees can store the sale in the system. Users will access the app through a log in screen using their employee ID and password that are made during account registration.
